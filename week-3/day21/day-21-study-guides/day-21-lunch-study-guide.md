# üç≤ Day 21 Lunch: Hands-On Practice Labs

## üß† Objective
Apply the concepts from the morning session through real-world Linux sysadmin simulations:
- Secure user creation
- Firewall rule management
- IDS analysis
- Backup restoration

---

## üîê Lab 1: User Permissions Simulation

### Goal:
Create a minimal-privilege user with locked-down home access and sudo rights.

### Commands:
```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash secure_user
sudo passwd secure_user
sudo usermod -aG sudo secure_user
sudo chmod 700 /home/secure_user

What You Learn:

    Principle of Least Privilege

    Sudo access with tight home permissions

üõ°Ô∏è Lab 2: Firewall Rule Simulation
Goal:

Simulate configuring iptables for a locked-down but SSH-accessible server.
Commands:

sudo iptables -F
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules

What You Learn:

    Stateful firewall management

    Whitelisting only essential ports

üïµÔ∏è Lab 3: IDS Monitoring (Snort & Wireshark)
Goal:

Understand how to inspect traffic and simulate detection of suspicious packets.
Simulated Commands:

sudo snort -A console -i eth0 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
sudo wireshark &

Wireshark Filters to Try:

    tcp.port == 22

    http

    dns

What You Learn:

    Real-time network monitoring and packet inspection

    Practical use of IDS in a secure network

üíæ Lab 4: Backup Restoration Practice
Goal:

Simulate restoring a backup archive and verifying its integrity.
Commands:

sudo tar -xzvf /backups/home_backup.tar.gz -C /
sha256sum -c checksums.txt
sudo systemctl restart sshd

What You Learn:

    Disaster recovery techniques

    File integrity checking

    Service restoration

By the end of lunch, you should be able to:

    Add and secure new users

    Write and apply basic firewall rules

    Analyze traffic using IDS tools

    Restore from and validate backup archives
