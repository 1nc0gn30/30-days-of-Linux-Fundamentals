## Day 4 Lunch: Advanced File Editing and Understanding Permissions

Welcome to Day 4 Lunch! In this session, we'll take a deep dive into advanced usage of the vim and nano text editors and explore file permissions in detail. We'll dissect how permissions are represented and manipulated, giving you a robust understanding of file security and management.
Day 4 Lunch: C Code Implementation

Here's a C program that covers advanced text editing with vim and nano, and provides a detailed explanation of file permissions.

    printf("Examples:\n%s\n", examples);
    printf("Press Enter to continue...\n");
    getchar(); // Wait for user to press Enter
}

// Function to ask a question and check the answer
void ask_question(const char *question, const char *correct_answer) {
    char answer[100];
    printf("%s\n", question);

Day 4 Lunch Study Guide
1. Advanced Editing with vim

Commands:

    i: Enter insert mode to start editing.
    :w: Save changes to the file.
    :q: Quit vim without saving changes.
    :wq or :x: Save changes and quit vim.
    /pattern: Search for a specific pattern in the file.
    :%s/old/new/g: Replace all occurrences of 'old' with 'new' globally in the file.
    :set number: Show line numbers in the editor.
    :!command: Execute an external command (e.g., :!ls to list files).

Description:

    vim offers powerful text-editing capabilities and customization. Mastery of these commands will enable efficient and advanced editing.

2. Advanced Editing with nano

Commands:

    ^K: Cut a line (Ctrl+K).
    ^U: Paste the cut line (Ctrl+U).
    ^W: Search for text (Ctrl+W).
    ^_: Go to a specific line number (Ctrl+_).
    ^O: Save the file (Ctrl+O).
    ^X: Exit the editor (Ctrl+X).
    ^J: Justify (wrap) text (Ctrl+J).

Description:

    nano provides a simpler interface compared to vim but supports several advanced features for efficient text editing.

3. Understanding File Permissions

Permissions Breakdown:

    r (read): View file contents.
    w (write): Modify file contents.
    x (execute): Run the file as a program.

Examples:

    rwxr-xr-x: Owner has read/write/execute permissions, group and others have read/execute permissions.
    chmod 755 file.txt: Set permissions to rwxr-xr-x.
    chmod u+x file.txt: Add execute permission for the user.
    chmod go-r file.txt: Remove read permission for group and others.
    ls -l file.txt: Display file permissions in long listing format.

4. Permission Values and Calculation

Numeric Representation:

    4 = r (read)
    2 = w (write)
    1 = x (execute)
    7 = rwx (read, write, execute)

Examples:

    644 = rw-r--r-- (owner has read/write, group/others have read only)
    755 = rwxr-xr-x (owner has read/write/execute, group/others have read/execute)

Description:

    Permissions are represented numerically in octal format. Each digit represents permissions for the owner, group, and others.
