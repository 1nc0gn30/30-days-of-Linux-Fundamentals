## üçΩÔ∏è Day 24 Lunch: Writing Playbooks

**Objective**: Learn how to create and execute Ansible playbooks to automate system tasks across multiple machines.

---

### üñãÔ∏è Creating Your First Ansible Playbook

An **Ansible playbook** is a YAML file containing a list of actions (tasks) for Ansible to perform on managed nodes.

#### üìö Example: Installing Nginx

```yaml
- name: Install Nginx on webservers
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure Nginx is installed
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
```

Save this file as `install_nginx.yml` and run it using:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts install_nginx.yml
```

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Managing Multiple Servers

To manage multiple servers:

1. Define groups in your inventory file:

```ini
[webservers]
192.168.1.10
192.168.1.11

[dbservers]
192.168.1.20
```

2. Target specific groups in playbooks using the `hosts` key.

This makes it easy to roll out updates or changes across a fleet of machines.

### üîπ Common Modules in Ansible

Modules are the building blocks of tasks in playbooks. Here are some commonly used ones:

| Module    | Purpose                                 | Example                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `apt`     | Manage packages on Debian-based systems | `apt: name=nginx state=present`                 |
| `yum`     | Manage packages on RedHat-based systems | `yum: name=httpd state=present`                 |
| `copy`    | Copy files to remote hosts              | `copy: src=/file.txt dest=/tmp/file.txt`        |
| `service` | Manage services                         | `service: name=nginx state=started enabled=yes` |
| `command` | Run shell commands (no variables)       | `command: /usr/bin/uptime`                      |
| `shell`   | Run shell commands (with vars, pipes)   | `shell: echo $HOME`                             |

### ü§î Practice Task

Create a playbook to:

* Update the package cache
* Install htop
* Ensure the htop service is running (if applicable)

```yaml
- name: Install and run htop
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt cache
      apt:
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Install htop
      apt:
        name: htop
        state: present

    - name: Run htop (verify presence)
      command: which htop
```

### üìö Review Questions

1. What is a playbook and how is it structured?
2. How do you target specific groups of machines in your inventory?
3. What is the difference between the `command` and `shell` modules?
4. How would you install a package across multiple hosts?

### ‚úÖ Done?

Create your own playbook that installs multiple packages and configures a service, like setting up a basic web stack (nginx + ufw + fail2ban).
