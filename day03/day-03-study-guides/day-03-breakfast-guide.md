# Day 3 Breakfast Study Guide: Advanced File and Directory Management

Welcome to Day 3 Breakfast! Today, we will deepen our understanding of advanced file and directory management techniques. This guide will cover creating, copying, moving, and renaming files, as well as navigating directories with advanced options and commands.

## Creating Files with Advanced Techniques

### Commands
- **`touch`**: Create a new empty file or update the timestamp of an existing file.
  ```bash
  touch file1.txt

    echo: Create a file with initial content. The > operator will overwrite the file if it already exists.

    bash

echo 'Initial content' > file2.txt

cat: Create a file with multiline content using a here document.

bash

    cat > file3.txt <<EOF
    This is a new file.
    EOF

Examples

    Create a new empty file:

    bash

touch myfile.txt

Create a file with initial content:

bash

echo 'Hello World' > hello.txt

Create a file with multiline content:

bash

    cat > multiline.txt <<EOF
    Line 1
    Line 2
    Line 3
    EOF

Copying Files and Directories
Commands

    cp: Copy files or directories.

    bash

cp file1.txt backup/

cp -r: Recursively copy directories.

bash

cp -r source/ destination/

cp -a: Archive mode: Copy files and preserve attributes (like symlinks).

bash

cp -a source/ destination/

cp -u: Copy only if the source file is newer than the destination file.

bash

cp -u file1.txt backup/

cp -i: Prompt before overwriting files.

bash

    cp -i file1.txt backup/

Examples

    Copy a file to a directory:

    bash

cp document.txt /backup/

Recursively copy a directory:

bash

cp -r mydir/ mybackup/

Copy a directory preserving attributes:

bash

cp -a mydir/ mybackup/

Copy only newer files:

bash

    cp -u newfile.txt /backup/

Moving and Renaming Files
Commands

    mv: Move or rename files and directories.

    bash

mv file1.txt /path/to/destination/

mv -i: Prompt before overwriting files.

bash

mv -i file1.txt backup/

mv -u: Move only if the source file is newer than the destination file.

bash

    mv -u file1.txt backup/

Examples

    Move a file to a different directory:

    bash

mv report.txt /archives/

Rename a file:

bash

    mv oldname.txt newname.txt

Advanced Directory Navigation
Commands

    bash

cd /path/to/directory

cd ..: Move up one directory level.
