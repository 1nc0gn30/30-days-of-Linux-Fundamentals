## Introduction
Welcome to Day 08 of your Linux learning journey! This guide is designed to help you deepen your understanding of fundamental Linux concepts including file permissions, shell script editing, and user management. Each section provides a concise explanation along with practical examples, followed by interactive questions to test your knowledge.

## Lesson Summaries

### File Permissions and Ownership
**Topic:** Understanding file permissions and ownership  
**Description:**  
File permissions and ownership are vital for managing security and access control in a Linux environment. Every file has an owner and a group associated with it, and permissions determine who can read, write, or execute the file. Mastery of commands like `chmod` and `chown` is essential for any Linux user or administrator.

**Examples:**
- `chmod 755 myscript.sh`
- `chown user:group myfile.txt`

For more detailed information, refer to the [official documentation](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/chmod.1.html).

### Editing Shell Scripts
**Topic:** Editing and updating shell scripts  
**Description:**  
Editing shell scripts is a routine task for Linux users. Familiarity with text editors like `vi`, `nano`, or `emacs` allows you to efficiently create, modify, and maintain scripts. This lesson covers the basics of opening, editing, and saving files in these editors.

**Examples:**
- `vi myscript.sh`
- `nano myscript.sh`

For a complete guide, visit the [vi editor tutorial](https://www.washington.edu/computing/unix/vi.html).

### User and Group Management
**Topic:** Managing users and groups  
**Description:**  
User and group management is a core responsibility for system administrators. Commands like `useradd`, `usermod`, and `groupadd` allow you to add, modify, and manage users and groups, ensuring proper access and security protocols are followed.

**Examples:**
- `useradd newuser`
- `passwd newuser`
- `usermod -aG groupname username`
- `groupadd newgroup`

## Interactive Questions
After reviewing each lesson, test your knowledge with the following questions:

1. What command is used to change file permissions?  
   **Hint:** Use the format `command [options] filename`.

2. How do you change the ownership of a file?  
   **Hint:** Mention the command used to change both the user and group ownership.

3. How can you edit a script using the vi editor?  
   **Hint:** Explain how to open a file in `vi` and the basic command to enter insert mode.

4. What command adds a new user to the system?  
   **Hint:** Provide the command that is followed by the username.

5. How do you add a user to a group?  
   **Hint:** Use the command that modifies a user to include group membership.
