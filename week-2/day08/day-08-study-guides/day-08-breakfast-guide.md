# Da 09 Breakfast Study Guide: Shell Scripting and Package Compilation

## Introduction

Welcome to the study guide for Shell Scripting and Package Compilation! This guide covers key concepts and practices essential for mastering shell scripting and understanding package compilation. 

## Lessons

### 1. Shell Scripting Basics

**Description:**

Shell scripting automates tasks in Unix-based systems by writing a sequence of commands in a file. These scripts streamline workflows, manage system configurations, and perform repetitive tasks efficiently. 

**Key Concepts:**

- **Shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)**: Specifies the shell interpreter used to execute the script.
- **Common Use Cases**: Backup scripts, batch processing, environment setup.

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```
**Instructions:**

Save the script as hello.sh.
Make it executable: chmod +x hello.sh.
Run it: ./hello.sh.

2. Package Compilation
Description:

Compiling software from source allows customization of installations, performance optimization, and patch application.

Key Concepts:

Steps: Download source code, extract it, configure build, compile, install binaries.
Example Commands:


Copy code
```bash
wget http://example.com/package.tar.gz
tar -xvf package.tar.gz
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

3. Variables in Shell Scripts
Description:

Variables store data in scripts, making them dynamic and adaptable.

Key Concepts:

Creating Variables: Variables hold strings, numbers, or command output.
Usage: $variable to access the variable's value.
Example:

Copy code
```bash
my_variable="Hello, World!"
echo $my_variable
```

4. Control Structures in Shell Scripts
Description:

Control structures like if-else and loops (for, while) automate decision-making and repetitive tasks.

Key Concepts:

if-else Statements: Conditional execution of commands.
Loops: Iterate over data sets.
Example:


Copy code
```bash
if [ $my_variable = "Hello, World!" ]; then
  echo "Match found!"
else
  echo "No match."
fi

for i in 1 2 3; do
  echo $i
done
```

5. Functions in Shell Scripts
Description:

Functions organize reusable code, enhancing script readability and maintainability.

Key Concepts:

Defining Functions: Create blocks of reusable code.
Syntax: [function_name]() { [commands]; }
Example:


Copy code
```bash
my_function() {
  echo "Hello, World!"
}
my_function
```

6. Package Configuration Options
Description:

./configure scripts customize the build process by setting paths and enabling/disabling features.

Key Concepts:

--prefix Option: Sets the installation directory.
Customizing Builds: Use various options to tailor the build.
Example:

Copy code
```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
./configure --enable-debug
```

***Questions***

1. What is the purpose of the #!/bin/bash line in a shell script?
Answer:

The shebang line specifies the shell interpreter as /bin/bash.

2. What command is used to extract a tarball?
Answer:

The command to extract a tarball is tar -xvf.

3. What is the purpose of the export command in shell scripting?
Answer:

The export command is used to make a variable available to subprocesses.

4. How do you write an if-else statement in a shell script?
Answer:

The syntax is if condition; then action; else alternative; fi.

5. What is the difference between ./configure and ./configure --prefix=/usr/local?
Answer:

The latter sets the installation prefix to /usr/local.

6. How do you define a function in a shell script?
Answer:

A function is defined using the syntax my_function() { commands; }.
