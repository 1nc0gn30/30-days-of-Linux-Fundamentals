            "Each file has an owner and a group, and permissions can be set separately for the owner, the group, and others.\n"
            "Common commands include `chmod` to change permissions and `chown` to change ownership.",
            "Examples:\n"
            "  chmod 755 myscript.sh\n"
            "  chown user:group myfile.txt\n"
            "For more details, refer to the official documentation at https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/chmod.1.html."

            "Basic operations include opening a file, editing content, saving changes, and executing scripts.",
            "Examples:\n"
            "  vi myscript.sh\n"
            "  nano myscript.sh\n"

            "Commands like `useradd`, `usermod`, and `groupadd` are fundamental tools for these tasks.",
