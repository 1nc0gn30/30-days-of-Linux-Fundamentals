# Day 11 Dinner: Advanced Network Configuration

Welcome to Day 11 Dinner! In this session, we'll dive into advanced network configuration topics. We'll cover IPsec, load balancing, high availability, performance analysis, and security best practices. Prepare to enhance your skills and deepen your understanding of these critical network concepts.

## Lessons
### Lesson 1: Advanced Network Configuration with IPsec
**Description:**
Explore IPsec for securing IP communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet. Learn how to configure IPsec on Linux for secure communications.

**Commands:**
- **Install IPsec tools:**
```bash
  sudo apt-get install strongswan
```
Configure IPsec:
Edit /etc/ipsec.conf:
```bash
conn myvpn
  authby=psk
  keyexchange=ikev2
  left=%any
  leftsubnet=0.0.0.0/0
  right=%any
  rightdns=8.8.8.8
  rightsourceip=10.0.0.0/24
```
Restart IPsec service:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart strongswan
```
**Example:** Use IPsec to establish a secure VPN connection.

### Lesson 2: Load Balancing Techniques
**Description:**
Learn about load balancing to distribute network traffic across multiple servers or resources to improve performance and reliability.

**Commands:**

Configure load balancing with nginx:
Edit /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:
```bash
nginx
http {
  upstream backend {
    server 192.168.1.2;
    server 192.168.1.3;
  }
  server {
    location / {
      proxy_pass http://backend;
    }
  }
}
```
Restart nginx:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
**Example:** Use nginx to balance traffic between multiple web servers.

### Lesson 3: High Availability Configuration
**Description:**
Explore high availability solutions to ensure that critical services remain available even in the event of hardware or software failures.

**Commands:**

Configure high availability with keepalived:
Install keepalived:
```bash
sudo apt-get install keepalived
```
Edit /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf:
```bash
vrrp_instance VI_1 {
  state MASTER
  interface eth0
  virtual_router_id 51
  priority 101
  advert_int 1
  authentication {
    auth_type PASS
    auth_pass mypassword
  }
  virtual_ipaddress {
    192.168.1.100
  }
}
```
Restart keepalived:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart keepalived
```
**Example:** Use keepalived to provide a virtual IP address that can failover between multiple servers.

### Lesson 4: Network Performance Analysis
**Description:**
Deep dive into tools and techniques for analyzing network performance and identifying bottlenecks.

**Commands:**

Monitor network traffic with nload:
```bash
sudo nload
```
Analyze network throughput with iperf:
Server:
```bash
iperf3 -s
```
Client:
```bash
iperf3 -c <server_ip>
```
Check network latency and packet loss:
```bash
ping -c 100 <destination_ip>
```
**Example:** Use iperf to test throughput and ping to check latency and packet loss.

### Lesson 5: Security Best Practices for Network Configuration
**Description:**
Review security best practices for network configuration, including securing network services and implementing access controls.

**Commands:**

Secure SSH access with key-based authentication:
Generate a key pair:
```bash
ssh-keygen
```
Copy the public key to the server:
```bash
ssh-copy-id user@server
```
Disable password authentication in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
```bash
PasswordAuthentication no
Restart SSH service:
```
```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```
**Example:** Secure SSH access to prevent unauthorized logins.

### Lesson 6: Network Service Troubleshooting
**Description:**
Explore troubleshooting techniques for network services to diagnose and resolve issues effectively.

**Commands:**

Check service status with systemctl:
```bash
sudo systemctl status <service>
```
View service logs with journalctl:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u <service>
```
Check network service connectivity with telnet:
```bash
telnet <hostname> <port>
```
**Example:** Use systemctl to check service status and telnet to test connectivity to a specific port.
