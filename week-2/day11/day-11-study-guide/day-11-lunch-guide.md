# Day 11 Lunch: Advanced Network Configuration

Welcome to Day 11 Lunch! Today, we continue our deep dive into **Advanced Network Configuration**. This session is packed with practical lessons on advanced IP configurations, network bonding, DHCP, managing network services, performance optimization, and troubleshooting. By the end of this session, youâ€™ll have a strong grasp of these topics and be able to apply them confidently in real-world scenarios.

## Lessons

### Lesson 1: Advanced IP Configuration
**Topic:** Advanced IP Configuration  
**Description:**  
In this lesson, you'll explore advanced IP configuration tasks, including setting up IP aliases, configuring network bridges, and managing multiple IP addresses on a single interface.

**Commands:**
- To add an IP alias:
```bash
  sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.2/24 dev eth0
  ```
To set up a network bridge:
```bash
sudo ip link add name br0 type bridge
sudo ip link set dev br0 up
```
To add an interface to the bridge:
```bash
sudo ip link set dev eth0 master br0
```
**Example:** Use network bridges to combine multiple network interfaces into a single logical network.

**Instructions:**
Open a separate terminal and type the commands described above. Experiment with adding IP aliases and setting up network bridges. When ready, press Enter to continue.

### Lesson 2: Configuring Bonding Interfaces
**Topic:** Configuring Bonding Interfaces
**Description:**
Learn about network bonding, which allows combining multiple network interfaces into a single virtual interface for redundancy or increased bandwidth.

**Commands:**

To configure bonding on Linux:
Edit /etc/network/interfaces or create a bonding configuration file:
```bash
auto bond0
iface bond0 inet static
  address 192.168.1.10
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  bond-slaves eth0 eth1
  bond-mode 802.3ad
```
To bring up the bonded interface:
```bash
sudo ifup bond0
```
**Example:** Use bonding to improve network reliability and throughput.

**Instructions:**
Try setting up a bonding interface by following the commands above. Ensure you understand how to edit the network configuration file. When done, press Enter to proceed.

## Lesson 3: Advanced DHCP Configuration
**Topic:** Advanced DHCP Configuration
**Description:**
Dive into advanced DHCP configurations, including setting up DHCP relay agents and configuring DHCP options for various scenarios.

**Commands:**

To configure a DHCP relay agent:
```bash
sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-relay
```
Edit /etc/default/isc-dhcp-relay to set the relay parameters.
To define custom DHCP options:
Edit /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf to include options like:
```bash
option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8;
```
**Example:** Use DHCP relay agents to forward DHCP requests from clients in one subnet to a DHCP server in another subnet.

**Instructions:**
Follow the steps to set up a DHCP relay agent and configure custom DHCP options. Test these configurations in your environment. Press Enter when ready to continue.

### Lesson 4: Managing Network Services
**Topic:** Managing Network Services
**Description:**
Learn how to manage essential network services such as DNS and NTP on Linux.

**Commands:**

To configure DNS settings:
Edit /etc/resolv.conf to add nameserver entries:
```bash
nameserver 8.8.8.8
```
To install and configure NTP:
```bash
sudo apt-get install ntp
```
Edit /etc/ntp.conf to set NTP servers.
To check NTP synchronization:
```bash
ntpq -p
```
**Example:** Configure DNS and NTP services to ensure network name resolution and accurate time synchronization.

**Instructions:**
Configure DNS and NTP settings using the commands above. Verify the changes and test NTP synchronization. Press Enter to proceed to the next lesson.

### Lesson 5: Network Performance Optimization
**Topic:** Network Performance Optimization
**Description:**
Explore techniques for optimizing network performance, including adjusting network buffers and tuning kernel parameters.

**Commands:**

To adjust network buffer sizes:
```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=16777216
sudo sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=16777216
```
To tune kernel parameters for network performance:
```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout=30
```
**Example:** Optimize network performance by tuning kernel parameters to handle high throughput or latency-sensitive applications.

**Instructions:**
Experiment with adjusting network buffer sizes and tuning kernel parameters. Observe the effects of these changes. When ready, press Enter to continue.

### Lesson 6: Network Troubleshooting Tools
**Topic:** Network Troubleshooting Tools
**Description:**
Review advanced network troubleshooting tools and techniques for diagnosing complex network issues.

**Commands:**

To use traceroute with options:
```bash
traceroute -n <destination_ip>
```
To capture and analyze packets:
```bash
sudo wireshark
```
To perform network performance testing:
```bash
iperf3 -s  # Server
iperf3 -c <server_ip>  # Client
```
**Example:** Use wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic for detailed troubleshooting and performance testing.

**Instructions:**
Try using the tools above to troubleshoot network issues. Capture and analyze packets using wireshark and test network performance with iperf3. When finished, press Enter to proceed to the questions.
