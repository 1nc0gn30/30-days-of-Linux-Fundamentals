# Day 13 Lunch Study Guide: User and Group Management

## Overview
In this session, we will focus on User and Group Management. We will cover creating, modifying, and deleting users and groups.

## Lessons

### Lesson 1: System Monitoring Tools Overview

Effective system monitoring involves using various tools to keep track of system performance and health. Key tools and their usage:

- **`top`**: Provides a real-time, dynamic view of system processes, CPU, and memory usage.
  ```bash
  top
vmstat: Reports information about virtual memory, processes, and system performance.
bash
Copy code
vmstat
iostat: Reports CPU and I/O statistics, helping you understand disk usage and performance.
bash
Copy code
iostat
netstat: Provides network-related statistics, including connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.
bash
Copy code
netstat
sar: Collects and reports system activity data, useful for historical performance analysis.
bash
Copy code
sar
These tools are essential for identifying performance bottlenecks and ensuring optimal system operation.

Lesson 2: Understanding CPU and Memory Usage
Monitoring CPU and memory usage helps in identifying resource constraints and optimizing performance. Commands and examples:

top Command:

bash
Copy code
top
Press Shift + P to sort by CPU usage.
Press Shift + M to sort by memory usage.
vmstat Command:

bash
Copy code
vmstat
Displays columns like procs, memory, swap, io, system, and cpu.
Use vmstat 5 to update statistics every 5 seconds.
iostat Command:

bash
Copy code
iostat
Displays CPU usage and disk I/O statistics.
Use iostat 5 for 5-second intervals.
Monitoring these metrics helps in diagnosing performance issues related to CPU and memory utilization.

Lesson 3: Disk and Network Performance Monitoring
Understanding disk and network performance is critical for maintaining system efficiency and diagnosing issues. Commands and examples:

iostat for Disk Performance:

bash
Copy code
iostat -x
Provides extended statistics for disks.
netstat for Network Statistics:

bash
Copy code
netstat -i
Displays network interfaces and their statistics.
bash
Copy code
netstat -s
Displays network statistics by protocol.
Analyzing disk and network performance helps in managing I/O operations and network traffic efficiently.

Lesson 4: Historical Data Collection and Analysis
Collecting and analyzing historical data helps in identifying long-term trends and performance issues. Commands and examples:

sar Command:

bash
Copy code
sar -u 1 3
Reports CPU usage every second for 3 intervals.
bash
Copy code
sar -r 1 3
Reports memory usage every second for 3 intervals.
sar -n DEV for Network Performance:

bash
Copy code
sar -n DEV 1 3
Reports network device statistics every second for 3 intervals.
Using sar effectively provides insights into historical performance, which is crucial for capacity planning and identifying trends.

Lesson 5: Best Practices for Performance Tuning
Implementing best practices for performance tuning ensures that the system operates efficiently and effectively. Tips and recommendations:

CPU Tuning: Adjust scheduling priorities using nice and renice commands.
bash
Copy code
nice -n 10 command
renice -n 10 -p PID
Memory Tuning: Configure swap space and manage memory limits.
bash
Copy code
swapon -s
free -h
Disk Tuning: Optimize file systems and use tools like fsck for filesystem checks.
bash
Copy code
fsck /dev/sdX
Network Tuning: Adjust network settings and optimize TCP/IP stack parameters.
bash
Copy code
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling=1
Regular maintenance and tuning based on best practices are vital for maintaining optimal system performance.
